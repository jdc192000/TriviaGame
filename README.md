1) add code to rendor answers via JSQUERY.  (This was working prior to some enhancement)
2) check for correct answers.   Did not get to that due to #1 breaking.   I was attempting to enhance the visuals prior to fixing the backend.  I had it working at onetime, didn't save it, and couldn't recreate what I had coded.
